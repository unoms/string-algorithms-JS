# String-searching algorithms

 ## Algorithms

 * findSubstring.html - has a function which checks the presence of a substring inside a string. It's a simple algorithm with time complexity - О( string.length * substring.length)
 * findSubstringHash.html - uses Rabin–Karp algorithm (it uses hash function)
 * findSubstringKMP.html - uses Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm. Prefix function helps to make a better time complexity - O(string.length + substring.length)
 * Zfunction.html - has two realisations of Z function
 * findSubstrBoyer_Moore.html is a realisation of Boyer–Moore Algorithm.
